"""The scanner must find and read what the current recorder writes.

The scanner globbed ``capture.db`` and queried a ``capture`` table and an
``events`` table. openadapt-capture PR #28 replaced that bespoke format on
2026-07-17 with a SQLAlchemy database named ``recording.db`` whose tables are
``recording``, ``action_event`` and ``screenshot``. Nothing a user records
today matched the glob, so ``openadapt-viewer catalog scan`` found zero
recordings on a machine full of them.

Renaming the glob alone would not have fixed it. The two formats share no
table and no column, so a path-only change registers a directory with no date,
no duration and no counts. These tests therefore assert the values, not the
count of rows returned.

They run against the recordings openadapt-capture commits under
``examples/captures/``, not against a database written here to match this
module's own assumptions. A test that builds its own input can only prove the
reader agrees with the test author. ``tests/capture_examples.py`` locates them.
